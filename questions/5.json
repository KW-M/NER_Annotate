{"text": "Word 2011: In track changes mode \"final showing markup\", most text missing in some table rows\n\nI'm using track changes to edit a large table (several columns, many rows\nspanning multiple pages). Some columns have only one or a few words, while\nothers have two or three paragraphs of one to three sentences each.\n\nThe problem I'm having is that with track changes turned on in \"final showing\nmarkup\" mode, there are several table rows in which only the last word in the\nlast paragraph is actually displayed (this is true whether there's only one\nword, several words, or one or more paragraphs in a given cell). The displayed\ntext is in the right physical location, but the rest of each cell's area is\nblank. This problem seems to happen only in table rows that have been heavily\nedited and only in some but not all heavily edited rows.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea of why this occurs and how to fix it?\n\n", "ents": [{"start": 5, "end": 9, "label": "DATE"}, {"start": 213, "end": 221, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 256, "end": 268, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 283, "end": 295, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 569, "end": 572, "label": "CARDINAL"}]}

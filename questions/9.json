{"text": "Is 3G-less iPad considerably faster on wifi than iPad 3G?\n\nI've just experimented with three 3G-less iPads and they all were much faster\nthan this one iPad 3G that just never goes through my 128mb download, all over\nthe same wifi. They're also all 16gb, if that matters.\n\nThen I went on to find if this had something to do with the iPad models and\nthe only thing I could find is more people curious about it, but no conclusive\nevidence or reasoning.\n\nSo I came up with this simple testing procedure, which I hope people can\nreplicate. This is not meant to be a complete benchmark - just some data\npoints to analyze:\n\nGet 2 iPads of same model, one with 3G the other without it.\n\nThen, proceed with the following steps in both of them:\n\nIn each one, go to `Settings > General > Reset >` `Reset Network Settings`\n\nConnect to the same, good wifi.\nDownload something big from a LAN server. Measure how long it takes.\nOptional to (4): On apple store, download Speedtest X and use it 6 times.\nShare results.\n\nHere are mine, in Mb/s. Again, this is a wifi simplistic test on different\niPad models:\n\n no 3G: down 6.39, 9.70, 1.45, 7.24, 11.59, 13.77 - up 0.68, 0.53, 0.52, 0.52, 0.52, 0.68\n w/ 3G: down 1.01, 2.17, 11.45, 11.47, 4.77, 0.43 up 0.68, 0.75, 0.67, 0.67, 0.15, 0.15\n\nNo mistake there, my down stream is pretty unstable, but I think this still\nshows my 3G is a lot worst, given it would probably keep consistently lower if\nI kept testing, because that's how it's been feeling like. I was even\nsurprised I got 2 high peaks on the 3G iPad, because generally my experience\nwith it today rely exclusively on the other results - vastly inferior.\n\nSo, the question here still is: is there any rationale for the iPad 3G to be\nso much slower on wifi? Or maybe is it my device that's defective?\n\nedit: I'll be adding my results with step 4 as soon as I can do it. It is a\nnew idea from Gerry.\n\n", "ents": [{"start": 3, "end": 5, "label": "DATE"}, {"start": 11, "end": 15, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 29, "end": 35, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 49, "end": 55, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 87, "end": 92, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 93, "end": 95, "label": "DATE"}, {"start": 147, "end": 150, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 151, "end": 157, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 191, "end": 196, "label": "QUANTITY"}, {"start": 248, "end": 250, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 332, "end": 336, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 621, "end": 622, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 644, "end": 647, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 653, "end": 654, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 755, "end": 782, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 874, "end": 877, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 926, "end": 927, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 933, "end": 938, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 955, "end": 966, "label": "PRODUCT"}, {"start": 978, "end": 979, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1025, "label": "LOC"}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1097, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1109, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1115, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1121, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1127, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1129, "end": 1134, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1136, "end": 1141, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1147, "end": 1151, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1157, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1163, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1169, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1175, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1177, "end": 1181, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1187, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1195, "end": 1199, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1201, "end": 1205, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1207, "end": 1212, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1219, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1225, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1231, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1235, "end": 1239, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1245, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1251, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1257, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1263, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1265, "end": 1269, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1356, "end": 1357, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1512, "end": 1513, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1533, "label": "ORDINAL"}, {"start": 1832, "end": 1833, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 1880, "end": 1885, "label": "GPE"}]}

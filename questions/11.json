{"text": "iOS app to edit .txt files (w/ Dropbox sync) that preserves Windows-style line breaks\n\nI commonly edit .txt files on my PC (Notepad) and my Mac (using TextEdit) and\nstore them in Dropbox. I would like also like to be able to edit these .txt\nfiles on my iOS devices. Every app that I've tried breaks the Windows-style\nline breaks; if I edit a .txt file, all line breaks are lost when I open that\nfile in Notepad.\n\nIs there any iOS app which can edit .txt files and preserve Windows-style line\nbreaks? (Paid is OK, but cheaper is better.) I have tried iA Writer and Write\n2.\n\n", "ents": [{"start": 124, "end": 131, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 140, "end": 143, "label": "PERSON"}, {"start": 151, "end": 159, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 179, "end": 186, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 303, "end": 310, "label": "PRODUCT"}, {"start": 403, "end": 410, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 550, "end": 552, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 570, "end": 571, "label": "CARDINAL"}]}

{"text": "Repeated \"Connect to iTunes to Use Push Notifications\" prompts?\n\nI just backed up my iPhone 4S and restored it onto my iPhone 5. Now, whenever\nI open \"Find My Friends\", I get a continuous stream of these messages:\n\nConnect to iTunes to Use Push Notifications\n\n>\n\n\"Find Friends\" Notifications may include alerts, sounds and icon badges.\n\nI can't actually do anything else with the app because as soon as I dismiss\none message, another (identical) one pops up. I tried deleting and re-\ndownloading the \"Find My Friends\" app, but I get the same result.\n\nAccording to this thread, I can fix the problem by doing a backup and restore\nonto my phone, but I'd rather not if I can help it. Is there another way to\nfix this?\n\n", "ents": [{"start": 126, "end": 127, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 151, "end": 166, "label": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"start": 264, "end": 276, "label": "WORK_OF_ART"}, {"start": 501, "end": 516, "label": "WORK_OF_ART"}]}

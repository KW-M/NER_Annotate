{"text": "Are there Anti-Theft apps for iPad similar to cerberus for Android\n\nI have been looking for some anti-theft applications for iPad, like the\nwonderful Cerberus application for Android which enables a lot of features to\nrecover your lost or stolen Android mobile for only 2/3\u20ac. Avast anti-theft\nalso worked perfectly in my Android phone and its free.\n\nI would like to know if you have tested any of them in you Apple device and\ncould give me a hint before buying it. It will be a plus if it could detect if\nthe 3G microSIM card is removed, and send an SMS to another mobile like Avast\nanti-theft application for Android does.\n\nI don't mind about price, the more features the better.\n\nI would like the following options:\n\n Remote control of the lost/stolen device (get SMS, get files, capture screen, turn on camera..)\n Possible remote control by sending SMS.\n Check for location of stolen device via remote turning on GPS or using 3G or any other method.\n\n", "ents": [{"start": 10, "end": 20, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 30, "end": 34, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 59, "end": 66, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 125, "end": 129, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 150, "end": 158, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 175, "end": 182, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 246, "end": 253, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 265, "end": 275, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 276, "end": 281, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 321, "end": 328, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 409, "end": 414, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 509, "end": 510, "label": "CARDINAL"}, {"start": 577, "end": 582, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 610, "end": 617, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 916, "end": 919, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 929, "end": 930, "label": "CARDINAL"}]}

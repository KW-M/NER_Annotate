{"text": "launchtl: any way to disable a daemon after removing the plist file?\n\nI was trying to permanently disable a 3rd party daemon, so I deleted its plist\nfile from /Library/LaunchDaemons-- and then I realized that I hadn't done a\n`launchctl unload` on it first; trying after the fact yields \"No such file or\ndirectory/nothing found to unload\". And, of course the daemon is restartable,\nso when I kill it, it gets recreated.\n\nI tried doing `launchctl list` in hopes of getting a label to use for\n`launchctl remove` but the daemon is no longer listed.\n\nShort of rebooting, is there any way to get launchd to forget about the daemon\nand/or re-scan the configuration files?\n\n", "ents": [{"start": 108, "end": 111, "label": "ORDINAL"}, {"start": 250, "end": 255, "label": "ORDINAL"}, {"start": 454, "end": 459, "label": "CARDINAL"}]}

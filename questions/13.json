{"text": "Can I make unlocking the screensaver also unlock the login keychain?\n\nI have the screen saver on my Mac password protected, but unlocking the screen\nsaver does not unlock the login keychain. I know this because I get asked to\nunlock the login keychain shortly after unlocking the screensaver.\n\nYes, my login password and keychain password have been synchronized.\n\nYes, I've run Keychain First Aid and confirmed there are no problems.\n\nThe workaround is to change the Keychain Settings so the login keychain never\nautomatically locks, but I'd prefer to have it lock automatically, especially\non my laptop when it goes to sleep, but now with Mountain Lion and iCloud that\nmeans typing my password twice every time I wake my laptop: once for the\nscreensaver and once for the keychain.\n\nThere should be a way to make the screensaver also unlock the keychain just\nthe way the normal login also unlocks the keychain. Is there?\n\n", "ents": [{"start": 100, "end": 103, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 387, "end": 396, "label": "PERSON"}, {"start": 463, "end": 484, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 640, "end": 664, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 676, "end": 682, "label": "DATE"}]}
